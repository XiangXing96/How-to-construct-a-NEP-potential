In this folder, we want to construct an initial dataset with hundreds of structures. The process contains five steps:  
1. conduct aimd simulations. extract some structrures from aimd trajectories and construct a rough nep model.  
2. displace atoms in structures. The structure can be obtained from aimd.  
3. pick structures from aimd trajectories based on the distance in latent space;
4. conduct DFT simulations at a higher accuracy (increase k mesh or energy cutoff). 
5. merge SCF results.

“It is very important to set vasp simulations properly!!!!”
