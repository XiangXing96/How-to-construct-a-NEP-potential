In this folder, we want to construct an initial dataset with hundreds of structures. The process contains five steps:  
1. conduct aimd simulations;  
2. extract some structrures from aimd trajectories and construct a rough nep model;  
3. pick structures from aimd trajectories based on the distance in latent space;
4. displace atoms in extracted structures from aimd and choose some of them based on the distance in latent space;
5. conduct DFT simulations at a higher accuracy (increase k mesh or energy cutoff).
